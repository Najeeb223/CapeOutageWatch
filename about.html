            <p>
                CapeOutageWatch (COW) is a community-driven tool designed to provide a quick, centralized view of essential service interruptions in the Cape Town area, focusing primarily on Electrical and Water & Sanitation outages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We fetch publicly available service alert data from the city's alerts API and present it in an easy-to-read, card-based format, allowing you to quickly check the status, location, and estimated resolution time for known issues in your neighborhood. Our goal is simple: to make finding outage information less frustrating, and provide notifications to users for outages should they decide to receive them.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
                **Note:** All alert data displayed here is sourced from the City of Cape Town's official channels. COW simply presents this data in a more accessible format.
